#PCA:The main purposes of a principal component analysis are the analysis of data to identify patterns and finding patterns to reduce the dimensions of the dataset with minimal loss of information.

#In PCA, we are interested to find the directions (components) that maximize the variance in our dataset

#Through PCA, we are projecting the entire set of data (without class labels) onto a different subspace

#in PCA we are trying to find the axes with maximum variances where the data is most spread (within a class, since PCA treats the whole data set as one class)

#What is a “good” subspace?

#Let’s assume that our goal is to reduce the dimensions of a d-dimensional dataset by projecting it onto a (k)-dimensional subspace (where k<d). So, how do we know what size we should choose for k, and how do we know if we have a feature space that represents our data “well”?
#Later, we will compute eigenvectors (the components) from our data set and collect them in a so-called scatter-matrix (or alternatively calculate them from the covariance matrix). Each of those eigenvectors is associated with an eigenvalue, which tell us about the “length” or “magnitude” of the eigenvectors. If we observe that all the eigenvalues are of very similar magnitude, this is a good indicator that our data is already in a “good” subspace. Or if some of the eigenvalues are much much higher than others, we might be interested in keeping only those eigenvectors with the much larger eigenvalues, since they contain more information about our data distribution. Vice versa, eigenvalues that are close to 0 are less informative and we might consider in dropping those when we construct the new feature subspace.
